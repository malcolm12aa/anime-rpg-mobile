# Build Your Legend

A modular, static, mobile-friendly text RPG foundation for GitHub Pages.

## Important setup

For GitHub Pages, `index.html` must be at the **root of your repository**. This fixed ZIP is already arranged that way:

```text
index.html
css/styles.css
js/main.js
js/core/...
js/data/...
js/systems/...
js/ui/...
```

Do **not** upload the whole ZIP as one file. Unzip it first, then upload the files and folders inside it.

## Local testing note

This version uses JavaScript modules. Many browsers block module imports when you double-click `index.html` from your computer or phone files. It should work normally on GitHub Pages. For local testing, use a simple web server, such as:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## What was fixed in this package

- Added `index.html` directly at the ZIP root so GitHub Pages can find it.
- Added a loading screen instead of a blank page.
- Added an on-screen error panel for JavaScript errors.
- Added a warning if the game is opened directly from files instead of hosted.
- Hardened save/load/delete save against blocked `localStorage`.
- Re-tested the main flow: menu → character creation → hub → status/progression/skills/inventory/shop/map → dungeon → battle.
